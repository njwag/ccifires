Using data from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI), this notebook aims to show how soil moisture anomalies can be used in the context of wildfire prediction. This notebook was created by me to be used as an exercise for the [*IV ESA EARSEL CNR School: Remote Sensing for Forest Fires*](https://eo4society.esa.int/event/iv-esa-earsel-cnr-school-2019/). Course materials can be downloaded [here](https://eo4society.esa.int/resources/iv-esa-earsel-cnr-school-2019/).
