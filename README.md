Using data from the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI), this notebook aims to show how soil moisture anomalies can be used in the context of wildfire prediction. This notebook was created as an exercise for the IV ESA EARSEL CNR School: Remote Sensing for Forest Fires (https://eo4society.esa.int/event/iv-esa-earsel-cnr-school-2019/).
